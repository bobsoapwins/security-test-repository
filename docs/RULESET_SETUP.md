# Repository Ruleset Setup Guide

This document describes the **branch protection rulesets** that must be configured in
the GitHub repository settings to enforce the security posture of this repository.

GitHub Rulesets are configured in **Settings → Rules → Rulesets** in the repository UI,
or via the GitHub REST API / GitHub CLI.

---

## Ruleset 1 — Main Branch Protection (Required)

**Name:** `main-branch-protection`  
**Enforcement:** `Active`  
**Target:** Branch `main`

| Restrict updates | ✅ Enabled — require pull requests |
| Restrict deletions | ✅ Enabled |
| Require linear history | ✅ Enabled |
| Require deployments to succeed | ✅ Enabled (configure target environment) |

## Ruleset 2 — Repository Lockdown (Emergency Use)

**Name:** `repository-lockdown`  
**Enforcement:** `Disabled` by default — `Active` during a lockdown incident  
**Target:** All branches (`~ALL`)

When this ruleset is set to **Active**, it applies the following ultra-restrictive rules:

| Rule | Setting |
|------|---------|
| Restrict creations | ✅ Enabled |
| Restrict updates | ✅ Enabled |
| Restrict deletions | ✅ Enabled |
| Block force pushes | ✅ Enabled |
| Require signed commits | ✅ Enabled |
| Bypass list | Repository admins only |

**To activate lockdown:**  
1. Trigger the `Repository Lockdown` workflow (see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)).  
2. Then navigate to **Settings → Rules → Rulesets → `repository-lockdown`** and set
   enforcement to **Active**.

**To deactivate after incident resolution:**  
Set enforcement back to **Disabled** once the incident is fully resolved.

## Ruleset 3 — Tag Protection

**Name:** `tag-protection`  
**Enforcement:** `Active`  
**Target:** Tags (`~ALL`)

| Rule | Setting |
|------|---------|
| Restrict creations | ✅ Enabled — only admins |
| Restrict deletions | ✅ Enabled |
| Block force pushes | ✅ Enabled |

## Configuring via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# https://cli.github.com/

# Activate repository-lockdown ruleset (emergency)
gh api \
  --method PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets/<RULESET_ID> \
  -f enforcement=active

# Deactivate after incident is resolved
gh api \
  --method PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets/<RULESET_ID> \
  -f enforcement=disabled
```

> Replace `{owner}` and `{repo}` with the actual repository owner and name, and
> replace `<RULESET_ID>` with the numeric ID shown in the URL when viewing the ruleset
> in the repository settings.
